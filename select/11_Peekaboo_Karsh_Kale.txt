Naina more taras gaye
Naina more taras Gaye
Aaja balam pardesi
Aaja balam pardesi
Naina more tharas gaye
Aaja balam pardesi
Aaja balam pardesi
Mor papaiya koyal bole
Mor papaiya koyal bole
Mujh birhan ka jiyara dole
Mujh birhan ka jiyara dole
Kare baadal garaja gaye
Aaja balam pardesi
Aaja balam pardesi
Remember the time when we first met
The very time that u tried to forget
Tell me my dear did u miss me at all
Did u reach out to touch me did u try to call
Did you reach out to touch me, yeaahhh
Peekaboo i found u again
Hiding in the corner with your imaginary friend
And im here tonight to see this through till the end
Coz I will always be with you.
India - waitin for my sisters to come home
Cuz my motherland is feelin oh so alone
Kismat say milkay asmaan meraa zameen
Jo hogayaa so hogayaa usi gabroo shakeen
A new day is here time to formulate the team
Slumgods never is the focus getting cream
More like setting up the scene for a dream to come true
Im lost between 2 languages ancient and new
Im a servant of truth but a master of lies,
Iiving in this world with perfect disguise
Im moving away that u won't recognize
When u look in the mirror you'll see through my eyes
See through my eyes
See through my eyes.
Peekaboo i found u again
Hiding in the corner with your imaginary friend
And im here tonight to see this through till the end
Tonight to see this through till the end
Cuz I will always be . and I will always be ...
And im here and I will always be with you!

NUVILICES - peekaboo
Verse I:
Push, push
Me away from you
We no good
You always knew
Rush to conclusions
You regret in the afternoon
But then you call me up at night
Showing your claws just like an eagle
Pretend without me you’re alright
But in the hotel suck like a sequel
Pre-Chorus:
I don’t know why you gotta do this
I don’t know how you came through to me
Chorus:
Peekaboo
Peekaboo
Games don’t stop
Hide and seek
Till the sun comes up
Peekaboo
Despicable things you say
"Baby just come out and play”
Peekaboo
Verse II:
Hush, hush
Like you always do
Keep me secret
Nothing new
Touch and it turns to gold
Give me the chemicals
And then you call me up at night
Telling me you deserve it better
Pretend without me you’re alright
Then you land smooth on me like a feather
Pre-Chorus
Chorus

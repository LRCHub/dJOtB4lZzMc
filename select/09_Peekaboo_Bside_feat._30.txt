Mora Beats
Trap House Mob

Sweep up with a broom not to clean my room
Shell out the tints when I squeeze at you
Hop off the bike, peekaboo
Woosh on man with this tree trunk too
I was in my cell, doing bang-up
Came out, loaded up nails in the hammer
This ratchet I got in the jammer
But I had a one shotty that was older than my grandma

Fling a corner in the pot when I tapped and it locks
So I'm with Lil D on your block with a dots
(Man's on your block now, haha)
B gang's cut from a different cloth
I make crack with magic in a witch's pot
Had the spin barrel spin like the wild wild west
Ask bro that day, I nearly kwenged in his head
They say we only rap about skengs on peds (Why?)
'Cah we really put skengs on pеds
HMP, me and bro shared a bunk bed
Thеn we touched road, shotting work to the junkheads
Left over there in a hot mess
And we saved one in the head for the stop
Interview 'bout a booting it's not my first time
One more GBH gonna be my third strike
But you know I never really paid that any mind
Green light from bro, hopping back in the ride
This one bad like Teanna Trump
She would ask 'How high?' if I told her to jump
Buss shots at the opps and they run like Gump
Want war with the B then you must be skunked
(Are you skunked?)
Didn't see none, went back on the next glide
Rear-view mirror, recognise them headlights
Pissed in the whip, bucked into the
Might decamp and come back a next time
Told the govs that I needed a razor to shave my beard
But you knew it was cap (Cap)
Me and bro took turns on a mash
Used toilet paper to cover the flak (The flak)
Friday, Saturday,
VR was hoping and wishing that bro came through on a visit
Bitch had a pack in her bra and knickers
I was in a cell with my festive slippers
Patting on the duke's keys, keeps banging his door
And he slit his wrist, he strung up before
And the pack just landed, need to bag up these 4s
You can tell no clippers to jam up the door
Back on the roads with the dipper for sure
Then I caught me a case, I was living on 4
Not new to jail, I been here before
Spent most of my teens in prison and court
Threw in the tings when we step out on freeflow
Bro caught a body, next day he went Heathrow
His co-d snitched, didn't stick to the G-code
He would've bussed case if it wasn't for Nino
Had the longest .12, tall like Peter Crouch
We're really outside, you don't leave your house
This one long, swing it round like a gymnast
Chop off the nose, now it fits in a gym bag
This buj here came from Pakistan
And the hand ting I got kick like Jackie Chan
Step with two Gs, don't need baggaman
Wrapped up my face, done it like Taliban
Manbag with the torch, they sting on the trigger,
Let me give it some foreplay
Asked little bro if he's gripping, he said 'Always'
Always got mine when I step through that doorway
Take a good look, I'm a blatant crook
Jakes want man booked like Bobby and Rowdy
Work in the pot, now the water's cloudy
I gave a few B to a fiend for his house keys
Took that third off, judge tryna bird man
I couldn't be bothered with the hassle at trial
Not guilty plea, bro just got the G
All now he ain't been back in a while

Sweep up with a broom not to clean my room
Shell out the tints when I squeeze at you
Hop off the bike, peekaboo
Woosh on man with this tree trunk too
I was in my cell, doing bang-up
Came out, loaded up nails in the hammer
This ratchet I got in the jammer
But I had a one shotty that was older than my grandma
